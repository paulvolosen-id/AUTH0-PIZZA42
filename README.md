# Auth0 Angular Pizza42 application - Paul Volosen - 

This sample demonstrates how to make secure calls to an API after authenticating a user with Auth0. The calls to the API are made with the user's `access_token`. The sample uses the Angular CLI.

## Getting Started

If you haven't already done so, [sign up](https://auth0.com) for your free Auth0 account and create a new client in the [dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com). Find the **domain** and **client ID** from the settings area and add the URL for your application to the **Allowed Callback URLs** box. If you are using the server provided by the Angular CLI, that URL is `http://localhost:3000/callback`.

You must ensure that the APIs section is enabled in your Auth0 dashboard. To do so, go to the [Advanced Settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/account/advanced) area and verify that **Enable APIs Section** is switched on. Next, navigate to APIs in the sidebar and create a new API. The identifier for your API will be required later.

Clone the repo or download it from the Angular quickstart page in Auth0's documentation. Install the Angular CLI and the dependencies for the app.

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
cd 03-Calling-an-API
npm install
```

## Set the Client ID, Domain, and API URL

If you download the sample from the quickstart page, it will come pre-populated with the **client ID** and **domain** for your application. If you clone the repo directly from Github, rename the `auth0-variables.ts.example` file to `auth0-variables.ts` and provide the **client ID** and **domain** there. This file is located in `src/app/auth/`.

You should also provide the identifier for the API you create in the Auth0 dashboard as your `apiUrl`.

## Set Up the `.env` File

In addition to the above-mentioned `auth0-variables.ts` file, a `.env` file is provided at the root of the application. This file provides your application's credentials to the small Node server located in `server.js`.

This file has two values, `AUTH0_AUDIENCE` and `AUTH0_DOMAIN`. If you download this sample from the quickstart page, the value for `AUTH0_DOMAIN` will be populated automatically, but you will still need to populate `AUTH0_AUDIENCE` manually. The value for `AUTH0_AUDIENCE` is the identifier used for an API that you create in the Auth0 dashboard.

## Run the Application

The development server that comes with the Angular CLI can be used to serve the application.

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be served at `http://localhost:3000`.

> **Note:** The default Angular CLI port is `4200`, but Auth0 samples use port `3000` instead.

## Run the Application With Docker

In order to run the example with docker you need to have `docker` installed.

You also need to set the environment variables as explained [previously](#set-the-client-id-domain-and-api-url).

Execute in command line `sh exec.sh` to run the Docker in Linux, or `.\exec.ps1` to run the Docker in Windows.

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, among others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).

## Create a free Auth0 account

1. Go to [Auth0](https://auth0.com/signup) and click Sign Up.
2. Use Google, GitHub or Microsoft Account to login.
